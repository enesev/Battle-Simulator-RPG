# Battle-Simulator-RPG

## Introduction
Hi there! 
Here, you will find our RPG battle simulator, able to build battles between warriors and wizards. The main objective of this project was to improve our skills by developing this powerful weapon for your entertainment. 

## Characters
Battles are created between two parties, formed by two character types with the following characteristics:

- Wizards are very intelligent characters that try to damage its oponents with a fireball(damage=his intelligence), but if they have not enough mana(5points), they will do a staff hit(damage=2).
- Warriors are strong characters able to do heavy attacks (damage=his strength), but if they have not enough stamina, they will perform a weak attack (damage=strength/2)
